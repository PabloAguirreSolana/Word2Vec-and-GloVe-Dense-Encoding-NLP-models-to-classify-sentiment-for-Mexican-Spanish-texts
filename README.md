# Word2Vec-and-GloVe-Dense-Encoding-NLP-models-to-classify-sentiment-for-Mexican-Spanish-texts
In this notebook I provide some examples to apply Dense Enconders (Word2vec and GloVe) to a Mexican-Spanish corpus to classify sentiment.


Word2vec and GloVe Embeddings
We can project words into a vector; where words with similar meanings have similar vectors. These vectors are also called the Word Embeddings for that particular word. Word Embeddings are a word representation type tha represents word in a 1D Vector. These representations allow similar meanings and similar semantics for similar vectors. Wich help us build better models to predict sentiment.

In this notebook I provide some examples to apply Dense Enconders (Word2vec and GloVe) to a Mexican-Spanish corpus to classify sentiment.

The dataset is a merge from several sources of corpus that have many tweets in mexican spanish:
